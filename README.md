- **Responsive Design**: Optimized to provide a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## Lessons Learned

While working on this project, I gained experience in:

- **Responsive Web Design**: Implementing layouts that adapt to various device sizes.

## Project Motivation

This project was inspired by my passion for both music and web development. As a fan of **Eminem**, I wanted to create a music player featuring his top tracks while practicing my frontend development skills. This allowed me to combine personal interest with learning, making the project both educational and enjoyable.
